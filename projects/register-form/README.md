## Objectives
* To create a structured layout for user data entry.
* To practice styling form elements like inputs, selects, and buttons.

## Key Features
* **Form Validation:** Uses "required" attributes to ensure users fill out all fields.
* **Interactive Button:** Features a hover effect that lifts the button slightly.
* **Clean Layout:** The form is perfectly centered on the screen for a modern look.
* **User Friendly:** Includes clear labels and placeholders to guide the user.

## Concepts Learned
* **CSS Flexbox:** Used to center the form within the full height of the viewport.
* **Form Elements:** Working with different input types like text, password, and checkboxes.
* **Hover Effects:** Implementing simple CSS transitions and transforms.
* **Box Sizing:** Using `border-box` to manage padding and width consistently.

## Tools and Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the form structure and input fields.
* **CSS3:** For the styling, layout, and interactive effects.
