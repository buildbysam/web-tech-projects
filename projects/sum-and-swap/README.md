# Sum and Swap

A PHP-based calculator that computes the sum of two numbers and demonstrates the swap logic.

## Project Preview

*The result page showing the original sum and the swapped values.*

## Objectives
Build a basic web application to process user input and practice mathematical logic using PHP.

## Key Features
* **Number Calculation:** Instantly calculates the sum of two user-provided integers.
* **Variable Swapping:** Shows how the values of two variables can be exchanged.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures that the user enters valid whole numbers before processing.
* **Clean Design:** A centered, card-based interface with clear typography.

## Concepts Learned
* **PHP POST Method:** Handling form data sent from one page to another.
* **Arithmetic Logic:** Implementing a swap algorithm using addition and subtraction.
* **Form Handling:** Using `required` attributes and PHP filters to validate user data.
* **Modular Code:** Using PHP `include` statements for headers and footers to keep code organized.

## Tools and Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* PHP
* Git
