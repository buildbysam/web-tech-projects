# Bubble Sort Visualizer

A simple web-based tool to visualize how the bubble sort algorithm works step-by-step.

## Project Description
This project is a beginner-friendly visualizer for the Bubble Sort algorithm. It allows users to generate a random list of bars and see how they move into the correct order. You can navigate through each step of the sorting process manually or jump straight to the finished result.

## Screenshots

## Objectives
Visualize how sorting algorithms reorganize data and build an interactive interface using PHP and HTML forms.

## Key Features
* **Customizable List Size:** Adjust the number of bars using a slider.
* **Step-by-Step Navigation:** Move forward and backward through the sorting steps.
* **Instant Finish:** Skip the steps and see the final sorted result immediately.
* **Dynamic UI:** Bars change height and position based on the algorithm's progress.

## Concepts Learned
* **PHP Logic:** Using loops to implement sorting and handling `POST` requests.
* **Data Passing:** Using hidden input fields to store and pass array data between page reloads.
* **Conditional Rendering:** Showing different buttons and text based on whether the sorting is finished.

## Tools and Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* PHP
* JavaScript
* Git
