## Objectives
* To use PHP for repeating repetitive HTML tasks.
* To practice centering elements and creating a responsive grid layout with CSS.

## Key Features
* **Dynamic Generation:** Uses nested PHP loops to create 16 numbered boxes automatically.
* **Hover Interaction:** Boxes change color smoothly when the mouse passes over them.
* **Perfect Centering:** The entire grid is perfectly centered in the middle of the browser window.
* **Modern Styling:** Features rounded corners, custom fonts, and a clean color palette.

## Concepts Learned
* **PHP For-Loops:** Using nested loops to handle row and column logic.
* **CSS Flexbox:** Utilizing `justify-content` and `align-items` for layout alignment.
* **CSS Transitions:** Adding smooth color changes using the `transition` property.
* **Inline-Flex:** Using `display: inline-flex` to align content inside small containers.

## Tools and Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the page structure and box containers.
* **CSS3:** For the background colors, grid spacing, and hover effects.
* **PHP:** To calculate numbers and echo the box elements to the page.
